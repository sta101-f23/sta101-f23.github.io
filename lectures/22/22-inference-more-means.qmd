# Warm up

## Announcements {.smaller}

-   Project 2 / Lab: Make sure to go to your assigned lab section

# From last time

## Application exercise

Go to Posit Cloud and continue the project titled `ae-16-Birth weights`.

# Inference for comparing two means

## Today's focus

-   Dive into: Inference for comparing two population means, but for groups that are dependent

-   Touch on: Inference for comparing many population means

## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(tidymodels)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Paired data {.smaller}

Two sets of observations are paired if each observation in one column has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other.

## Case study: Climate change {.smaller}

::: task
Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018. 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest, were sampled. We want to know: is there a difference in the average number of days with temperatures exceeding 90F in 2018 vs. in 1948?
