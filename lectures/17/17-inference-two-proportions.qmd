# Inference for two proportions

## NC poll on equality

A September 16-19, 2023, asked North Carolina voters, among other issues, about issues of equality and women's progress. Specifically, one of the questions asked:

> Which of these two statements come closest to your own views---even if neither is exactly right?
>
> -   The country has made most of the changes needed to give women equal rights with men.
>
> -   The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men.
