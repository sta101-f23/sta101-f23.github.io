Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. Focus on principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Research projects teach the process of scientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nIn this course, students learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. Critiquing data-based claims and evaluating data-based decisions is at the core of this course. Throughout the course students acquire a conceptual understanding and mastery of statistical and quantitative reasoning tools in order to be able to make such critiques and evaluations.\nIn addition, students are presented with novel data sets and application examples on a daily basis, and they use these data to model outcomes and make inferences about unknown population characteristics. Students learn that the first step of any analysis is identifying the assumptions and conditions necessary to apply the statistical technique(s) required to answer the research question at hand. Students not only learn the mechanics of the quantitative analysis, but also how to interpret conclusions based on quantitative evidence in context of the data and the research questions as well as identifying limitations due to data collection and study design.\nFor the lab component of this course students prepare weekly lab reports presenting statistical analysis of real data. In addition, students complete two independent data analysis projects where they answer significant research questions via the analysis of real data using statistical inference and modeling tools."

    "text": "Course community\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive.\nPlease update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta101-f23.github.io.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis."

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. Attendance will not be taken during class but you are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.

See Section 10.2 for policies on late work.\n\nAttendance and participation\nYou are expected to be present at class meeting and actively participate in the discussion. Your attendance and participation during class, as well as your activity on the course Slack will make up a non-insignificant portion of your grade in this class. While I might sometimes call on you during the class discussion, it is your responsibility to be an active participant without being called on.\nIf you attend at least 80% of the classes, you’ll get all available points for this component.\n\n\nInteractive tutorials\nYou will be assigned a number of interactive tutorials each week from the textbook. You will be asked to submit these on a weekly basis and graded on a check/no check basis.\nMake sure to add your name and your Net ID before generating the hash. Submit these in Canvas.\nIf you’ve completed at least 80% of the tutorials, you’ll get all available points for this component.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios. Labs will focus on both computation and conceptualization. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto and submitted as PDF for grading in Gradescope. While you may collaborate with others on lab assignments, your final solution should be your own.\nLowest lab score will be dropped.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams. Each exam will be comprised of two components:\n\nIn class: 75 minute in-class exam. This exam is closed book, however you are allowed to use one sheet of notes (“cheat sheet”) to the midterm and the final. This sheet must be no larger than 8 1/2 x 11, and must be prepared by you. You may use both sides of the sheet. (70% of the grade)\nTake home: Following the in class exam, you’ll have 48 hours to complete the take home portion of your exam. The take home portion will follow from the in class exam and focus on the analysis of a dataset introduced in the take home exam. (30% of the grade)\n\nThrough these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analyses and computational tasks related to the content in application exercises and labs. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\nSee Section 12 for dates and times of the exams. Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If you can’t take the exams on these dates, you should drop this class.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be a mid-semester prediction project and a final project. The prediction project will introduce you to conducting independent analyses and writing a formal report using a pre-specified data set. The final project allows you to explore a question and data set of your own. More details about the projects will be provided during the semester. Projects will be completed in teams.\nYou will be assigned to a different team for each of your two projects. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.\nSee Section 12 for dates and times of project deadlines. Project deadlines cannot be changed. If you can’t be in class for the final project presentation, you should drop this class."

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe labs must also be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to lab questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\nPolicy on late work depends on the particular course component:\n\nLabs:\n\nLate, but within 24 hours of deadline: -20% of available points.\nAny later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback.\nNote that lowest lab score will be dropped, even if that score is a 0.\n\nExams:\n\nIn class portions of the exams can obviously not be turned in late.\nLate exams are not accepted.\n\nProjects: The following three components contribute to your project score.\n\nPresentation: Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.\nWrite up: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, Slack/email me to reopen your repository.\n\nLate, but within 24 hours of deadline: -20% of available points.\nAny later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback.\n\nPeer evaluation: Late peer evaluations are not accepted. If you do not turn in your peer evaluation, you get 0 points for your own peer score as well, regardless of how your teammates have evaluated you.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the Head TA (Shuo Wang, shuo.wang717@duke.edu) before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nEvery effort will be made to mark your work accurately. We are on your side, and want you to receive every point you have worked to earn. However, sometimes grading mistakes happen. If you believe that an error has been made, return the paper to the instructor within four days, stating your claim in writing.\nThe following claims will be considered for re-grading:\n\npoints are not totaled correctly;\nthe grader did not see a correct answer that is on your paper;\nyour answer is the same as the correct answer, but in a different form (e.g., you wrote a correct answer as 1/3 and the grader was looking for 0.333);\nyour answer to a free response question is essentially correct but stated slightly differently than the grader’s expectation.\n\nThe following claims will not be considered for re-grading:\n\narguments about the number of points lost;\narguments about question wording.\n\nConsidering re-grades consumes time and resources that TAs and the instructor would rather spend helping you understand material. Please bring only claims of type 1-4 to our attention.\nNote that during the regrade process your score could go up or go down or not change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\nNote that attendance and participation is part of your grade as well.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919- 681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously, we may rely on Duke’s designated make-up days, or you may be asked to watch a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at https://policies.provost.duke.edu/docs/faculty-handbook-appendix-m-intellectual-property. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

    "text": "Exercise 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino data set. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this data set. Make sure that this value is printed in your document.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your .qmd document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote in R you may use either &lt;- or = for an assignment operator. We’ll use &lt;- in this class as it’s the more commonly used assignment operator, but when you look for R help online, you might see = being used as well.\n\n\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(dino_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate r only if relevant.\nIn this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear, but is instead more ‘dinosaur-esque’.\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\ndino_data |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0645"

The following paragraph will be useful in evaluating the lead amount values we’ll see in the dataset.\n\nWhile there is no completely safe amount of lead consumption, the limit allowed by the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) of 1991 is 15 parts per billion (ppb). If this is exceeded in more than 10% of homes tested (or if the 90th percentile value of the total sample is above 15 ppb), action is required. And to make sure problems are caught, sampling for lead in water is supposed to target the “worst-case” homes – those in areas served by lead pipes."
