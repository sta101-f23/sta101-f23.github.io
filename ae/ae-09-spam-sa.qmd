In this application exercise, we'll build a spam filter. Or, at least, learn a bit about how spam filters are built by building a very simple (likely not very effective) one.

# Goals

-   Understand logistic regression as a linear model of binary outcomes

-   Fit and interpret logistic regression models in R

# Packages and data

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

hp_spam <- read_csv("data/hp-spam.csv")
```

To illustrate logistic regression, we will build a spam filter from email data. Today's data consists of `r nrow(hp_spam)` emails that are classified as spam or non-spam.

-   `type = 1` is spam
-   `type = 0` is non-spam

The data was collected at Hewlett-Packard labs and contains `r nrow(hp_spam)` variables. The first 48 variables are specific keywords and each observation is the percentage of appearance of that word in the message. Click [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/kernlab/man/spam.html) to read more.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-data

glimpse(hp_spam)
```

The basic logic of our model is that the frequency of certain words can help us determine whether or not an email is spam.

For example, these emails came from George's inbox. If the word "george" (`george`) is not present in the message and the dollar symbol (`charDollar`) is, you might expect the email to be spam.

Using this data, we want to build a model that **predicts** whether a new email is spam or not. How do we build a model that can do this?

# Building intuition

## Exercise 1

One predictor model: Visualize a **linear model** where the outcome is `type` (spam or not) and `george` is the only predictor. Then, discuss your visualization with your neighbor. Is this a good model? Why or why not?

*Doesn't make sense to draw a line and predict values between 0 and 1.*

```{r}
#| label: one-predictor-plot

ggplot(hp_spam, aes(x = george, y = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Exercise 2

Two predictor model: In this exercise focus on two predictors: `you` and `capitalTotal`.

-   Create a visualization with `you` on the x-axis and `capitalTotal` on the y-axis. Color data points by whether or not they are spam (`type`). Make sure that `type` is being used as a categorical variable (factor).

```{r}
#| label: two-predictor-plot

hp_spam <- hp_spam |>
  mutate(type = as.factor(type))

ggplot(hp_spam, aes(x = you, y = capitalTotal, color = type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

-   Fit the model predicting `type` from `you` and `capitalTotal`. Comment on how the code differs from code used in previous models we fit. Also comment on how it's similar.

```{r}
#| label: spam-fit

spam_fit <- logistic_reg() |>
  fit(type ~ you + capitalTotal, data = hp_spam)
  
tidy(spam_fit)
```

## Exercise 3

Write the model equation.

$$
logit(\hat{p}) = -1.50 + 0.361 \times you + 0.00173 \times capitalTotal
$$

$$
log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}}) = -1.50 + 0.361 \times you + 0.00173 \times capitalTotal
$$

## Exercise 4

What is the probability the email is spam if the frequency of `you` is 5% in the email and there are 2500 capital letters.

-   First, so this "by hand" (using R as a calculator) and the model you wrote in the previous exercise.

```{r}
#| label: predict-manual

logit_phat <- -1.50 + 0.361*5 + 0.00173*2500
phat <- exp(logit_phat) / (1 + exp(logit_phat))
phat
```

-   Then, do it using R functions designed for prediction.

```{r}
#| label: predict-function

new_email <- tibble(
  you = 5,
  capitalTotal = 2500
)

predict(spam_fit, new_data = new_email)
predict(spam_fit, new_data = new_email, type = "prob")
predict(spam_fit, new_data = new_email, type = "class")
```

# Visualizing logistic regression

Just because there's greater than 50% probability an email is spam doesn't mean we have to label it as such. We can adjust our **threshold** or **critical probability**, a.k.a. **decision boundary** to be more or less sensitive to spam emails.

```{r}
#| label: decision-boundary
#| eval: true

spam_aug_1 <- augment(spam_fit, new_data = hp_spam)
decision_boundary <- 0.5

ggplot(spam_aug_1, aes(x = .pred_1, y = type)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkgray") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = decision_boundary, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

In other words we get to select a number $p^*$ such that

if $p > p^*$, then label the email as spam.

## Exercise 5

-   What would you set your decision boundary to and why?

-   Change `decision_boundary` in the code above to 0.01 and 0.999999. Do the results surprise you? Why or why not?

*Answers may vary.*

## Exercise 6

If you set a lower decision boundary, do you label fewer or more emails as spam? What happens if you set 0 as your boundary? What about 1 as your boundary? If you very much dislike spam, should you set a high or low boundary?

*Lower boundary means that we label more emails as spam, high boundary means fewer emails as spam. We can adjust the boundary depending on how much we value receiving important emails vs how much we dislike spam.*

*0 means all emails are spam, 1 means no emails are spam. Note you cannot set decision boundary to 0 or 1 because of logit function (would evaluate to inf or negative inf)*

# Classify a new email

Read a new email and figure out values of `you` and `capitalTotal` and store these in a new tibble called `new_email`.

```{r}
#| label: read-new-email

email_text <- read_lines("data/email-text.txt")
email_text

totalWord <- sum(str_count(email_text, " "))
totalYou <- sum(str_count(tolower(email_text), "you"))
you <- 100 * totalYou / totalWord
capitalTotal <- sum(str_count(email_text, "[A-Z]"))

new_email <- tibble(
  you = you,
  capitalTotal = capitalTotal
)
```

## Exercise 6

Using your model, predict whether this email will be classified as spam or not. What does the model predict for the **probability** that this email is spam? With a decision boundary of 0.5, how does the model classify thie email? Do you believe this classification? Why or why not?

```{r}
#| label: predict-new-email

predict(spam_fit, new_data = new_email)
predict(spam_fit, new_data = new_email, type = "prob")
```

*The model predicts 0.99 probability that this new email is spam. This seems reasonable based on the new email text.*

# Assessing predictive ability

We will divide the data into a training set and testing set.

```{r}
#| label: initial-split

set.seed(109)
hp_spam_split <- initial_split(hp_spam)
hp_spam_train <- training(hp_spam_split)
hp_spam_test <- testing(hp_spam_split)
```

## Exercise 7

Inspect `hp_spam_split`. How many emails are in `hp_spam_train`, how many are in `hp_spam_test`. Check out the documentation for the `initial_split()` function, what ratio does it use for splitting the dataset into training and testing samples?

## Exercise 8

Train your model on the training set. Build a predictive model using any combination of predictors from `hp_spam` to predict `type`. Save your fitted model as `my_model_fit` and display its tidy summary.

```{r}
#| label: my-model-fit

my_model_fit <- logistic_reg() |>
  fit(type ~ you + address, data = hp_spam_train)

tidy(my_model_fit)
```

## Exercise 9

Make predictions for your testing set and augment your testing set with these predictions.

```{r}
#| label: my-model-test

my_model_aug <- augment(my_model_fit, hp_spam_test) |>
  select(contains("pred"), type, you, address)
```

## Exercise 10

What are the false positive and false negative rates of this model?

```{r}
#| label: false-positive-negative

my_model_aug |>
  count(type, .pred_class) |>
  group_by(type) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```
