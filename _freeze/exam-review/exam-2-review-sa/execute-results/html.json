Add up the heights of the bars that contain simulated sample statistics with a value of 4.74 or higher and divide by the number of simulations. Approximately 352 (113+76+51+36+30+19+8+6+7+2+3+0+1) simulations out of 1,000 meet this criteria, resulting in a p-value of approximately 0.352.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exam-2-review-sa_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n7.  The p-value is much larger than 0.05, therefore the data do not provide convincing evidence that income bracket and preference for alcoholic beverage are dependent.\n\n8.  Take a random sample of size 25, with replacement, from the original sample. Calculate the proportion of students in this simulated sample who work 5 or more hours. Repeat this process 1000 times to build the bootstrap distribution. Take the middle 95% of this distribution to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of statistics majors who work 5 or more hours.\n\n9.
