Specifically, one of the questions asked:\n\n> Which of these two statements come closest to your own views---even if neither is exactly right?\n>\n> -   The country has made most of the changes needed to give women equal rights with men.\n>\n> -   The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men.\n\nThe data from this survey can be found in your `data` folder: `equality.csv`.\n\n# Hypotheses\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nThe two populations of interest in this survey are 18-24 year olds and 25+ year olds. State the hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a discernible difference between the proportions of those who think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men.\" (`need more changes`) in the two age groups.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Sample statistics\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nLoad the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCreate a 2x2 table of the responses across the two age groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhat proportion of 18-24 year olds think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men\"? What proportion of 25+ year olds? Calculate and visualize these proportions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nCalculate the observed sample statistic, i.e., the difference between the proportions of respondents who think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men\" between the two age groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Testing\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWhat is the parameter of interest?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nExplain how you can set up a simulation for this hypothesis test.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nConduct the hypothesis test using randomization and visualize and report the p-value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nWhat is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nInterpret the p-value in the context of the data and the hypotheses.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Estimation\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nEstimate the difference in population proportions of 18-24 year old NC voters and 25+ year old NC voters using a 95% bootstrap interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 12\n\nInterpret the confidence interval in context of the data.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 13\n\nDescribe how the simulation scheme for bootstrapping is different than that for the hypothesis test.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Conceptual\n\n## Exercise 14\n\nWhat is $p$ vs. $\\hat{p}$ vs. p-value.
