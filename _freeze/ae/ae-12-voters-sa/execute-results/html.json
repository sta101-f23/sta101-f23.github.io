Not everyone makes the time to vote in every election. Which best describes you? Are you certain to vote? Will you probably vote? Are the chances you will vote about 50/50? Or will you probably not vote?\n\nThe data from this survey can be found in your `data` folder: `voting-survey.csv`.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nWhat, if anything, do you know about voter turnout in the US?\n\n*\\~60% last presidential election.*\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nLoad the data and visualize the distribution of responses. Also calculate the proportion of respondents who are certain to vote in the next presidential election.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 2759 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): vote\ndbl (1): id\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-12-voters-sa_files/figure-html/vote-bars-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  vote                n p_hat\n  <chr>           <int> <dbl>\n1 Certain to vote  1921 0.696\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Estimation\n\nBased on these data, we want to estimate the true proportion of registered US voters who are **certain to vote** in the next presidential election.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWhat is the parameter of interest?\n\n*Proportion of all registered voters who are certain to vote in the next presidential election*\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nEstimate using a 95% bootstrap interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-12-voters-sa_files/figure-html/bootstrap-ci-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nSuppose the bounds of this interval are L = 0.681 and U = 0.713, your friend interprets the interval as\n\n> 95% of the time, the true proportion of registered US voters who are certain to vote in the next presidential election is between L and U.\n\nComment on this interpretation. Is it correct? If not, how would ix it?\n\n*Not correct. We are 95% confident that 68.1% to 71.3% of all registered voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election.*\n\n# Testing\n\nA newspaper claims that more than 60% of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election and cites this study as evidence. Do these data provide convincing evidence for this claim?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWhat are the hypotheses?\n\n*H0: There is nothing going on, 60% of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election. p = 0.6.*\n\n*HA: There is something going on, more than 60% of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election. p \\> 0.6.*\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nConduct a randomization test, at 5% discernability level, for this claim. What is the conclusion of the test?\n\n*The p-value is approximately 0, which is lower than the 5% discernability level, so we would reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Please be cautious in reporting a p-value of 0.

One friend claims:\n\n> The probability that 60% of all of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election is approx 0.\n\nAnother friend claims:\n\n> The probability that more than 60% of all of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election is approx 0.\n\nWho is right? Explain your reasoning.\n\n*Both friends are wrong. The p-value is neither the probability of H0 being true, not the probability of HA being true.*\n\n# Conceptual\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nWhat is $p$ vs. $\\hat{p}$ vs. p-value.
