Specifically, one of the questions asked:\n\n> Which of these two statements come closest to your own views---even if neither is exactly right?\n>\n> -   The country has made most of the changes needed to give women equal rights with men.\n>\n> -   The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men.\n\nThe results of this survey are summarized [in this report](https://www.meredith.edu/meredith-poll/n-c-voter-opinions-on-abortion-law-women-leaders-and-other-current-issues/) and the data can be found in your `data` folder: `equality.csv`.\n\n# Hypotheses\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nThe two populations of interest in this survey are 18-24 year olds and 25+ year olds. State the hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a discernible difference between the proportions of those who think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men.\" (`need more changes`) in the two age groups.\n\n*Let* $p$ *= the true proportion of those who think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men\" among 18-24 year old NC voters and 25+ year old NC voters.*\n\n$H_0: p_{18-24} = p_{25+}$\n\n$H_A: p_{18-24} \\ne p_{25+}$\n\n# Sample statistics\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nLoad the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nequality <- read_csv(\"data/equality.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCreate a 2x2 table of the responses across the two age groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nequality_table <- equality |>\n  count(age, response) |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"response\", values_from = \"n\") |>\n  rename(Age = age)\n\nequality_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Age   `Most changes done` `Need more changes`\n  <chr>               <int>               <int>\n1 18-24                  32                  35\n2 25+                   211                 450\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhat proportion of 18-24 year olds think \"The country needs to continue to make changes to give women equal rights to men\"?
