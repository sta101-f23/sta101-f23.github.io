Not everyone makes the time to vote in every election. Which best describes you? Are you certain to vote? Will you probably vote? Are the chances you will vote about 50/50? Or will you probably not vote?\n\nThe data from this survey can be found in your `data` folder: `voting-survey.csv`.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nWhat, if anything, do you know about voter turnout in the US?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nLoad the data and visualize the distribution of responses. Also calculate the proportion of respondents who are certain to vote in the next presidential election.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Estimation\n\nBased on these data, we want to estimate the true proportion of registered US voters who are certain to vote in the next presidential election.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWhat is the parameter of interest?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nEstimate using a 95% bootstrap interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nSuppose the bounds of this interval are L and U, your friend interprets the interval as\n\n> 95% of the time, the true proportion of proportion of registered US voters who are certain to vote in the next presidential election is between L and U.\n\nComment on this interpretation. Is it correct? If not, how would ix it?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Testing\n\nA newspaper claims that more than 60% of registered US are certain to vote in the next presidential election and cites this study as evidence. Do these data provide convincing evidence for this claim?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWhat are the hypotheses?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nConduct a randomization test, at 5% discernability level, for this claim. What is the conclusion of the test?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nSuppose the p-value you found is P, and your friends are in disagreement about the interpretation about this value. One friend claims:\n\n> The probability that 60% of all of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election is P.\n\nAnother friend claims:\n\n> The probability that more than 60% of all of registered US voters are certain to vote in the next presidential election is P.\n\nWho is right? Explain your reasoning.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Conceptual\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nWhat is $p$ vs. $\\hat{p}$ vs. p-value. Explain generically as well as in the context of these data and research question.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nWhat is sampling distribution vs. bootstrap distribution vs. null distribution? Explain generically as well as in the context of these data and research question.\n\n*Add response here.*\n",
