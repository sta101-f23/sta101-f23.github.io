We can write this distribution of $x$ in mathematical notation as\n\n$$\nx \\sim N(\\mu = 809, \\sigma = 140)\n$$\n\nLet's set the parameters of this distribution as objects you can use later.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbone_density_mean <- 809\nbone_density_sd <- 140\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nVisualize the distribution of bone density of 65-year-old women.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nBefore typing any code, based on what you know about the normal distribution, what do you expect the median bone density to be?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWhat bone densities correspond to Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (50th percentile), and Q3 (the 75th percentile) of this distribution?
