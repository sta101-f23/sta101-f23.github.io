This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. In this case study we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014. The length of pregnancy, measured in weeks, is commonly referred to as gestation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(births14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 13\n$ fage           <int> 34, 36, 37, NA, 32, 32, 37, 29, 30, 29, 30, 34, 28, 28,…\n$ mage           <dbl> 34, 31, 36, 16, 31, 26, 36, 24, 32, 26, 34, 27, 22, 31,…\n$ mature         <chr> \"younger mom\", \"younger mom\", \"mature mom\", \"younger mo…\n$ weeks          <dbl> 37, 41, 37, 38, 36, 39, 36, 40, 39, 39, 42, 40, 40, 39,…\n$ premie         <chr> \"full term\", \"full term\", \"full term\", \"full term\", \"pr…\n$ visits         <dbl> 14, 12, 10, NA, 12, 14, 10, 13, 15, 11, 14, 16, 20, 15,…\n$ gained         <dbl> 28, 41, 28, 29, 48, 45, 20, 65, 25, 22, 40, 30, 31, NA,…\n$ weight         <dbl> 6.96, 8.86, 7.51, 6.19, 6.75, 6.69, 6.13, 6.74, 8.94, 9…\n$ lowbirthweight <chr> \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", …\n$ sex            <chr> \"male\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\",…\n$ habit          <chr> \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"no…\n$ marital        <chr> \"married\", \"married\", \"married\", \"not married\", \"marrie…\n$ whitemom       <chr> \"white\", \"white\", \"not white\", \"white\", \"white\", \"white…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that there are some `NA`s in the `habit` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 |>\n  count(habit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  habit         n\n  <chr>     <int>\n1 nonsmoker   867\n2 smoker      114\n3 <NA>         19\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's drop those since we can't use those observations in our analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 <- births14 |>\n  drop_na(habit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Randomization test for comparing two means\n\n## Exercise 1 {#sec-exercise-1}\n\nSet the hypotheses for testing if there is a difference between mean birth weight of babies born to mothers who are smokers and those born to mothers who are not smokers.\n\n*Add answer here.*\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nCalculate the observed difference between the mean birth weight of babies born to mothers who are smokers and those born to mothers who are not smokers in this sample.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nSuppose the birth weights of the babies in this sample are written on pieces of paper.
