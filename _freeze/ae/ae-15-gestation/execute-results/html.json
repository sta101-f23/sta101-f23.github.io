This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. In this case study we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014. The length of pregnancy, measured in weeks, is commonly referred to as gestation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(births14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 13\n$ fage           <int> 34, 36, 37, NA, 32, 32, 37, 29, 30, 29, 30, 34, 28, 28,…\n$ mage           <dbl> 34, 31, 36, 16, 31, 26, 36, 24, 32, 26, 34, 27, 22, 31,…\n$ mature         <chr> \"younger mom\", \"younger mom\", \"mature mom\", \"younger mo…\n$ weeks          <dbl> 37, 41, 37, 38, 36, 39, 36, 40, 39, 39, 42, 40, 40, 39,…\n$ premie         <chr> \"full term\", \"full term\", \"full term\", \"full term\", \"pr…\n$ visits         <dbl> 14, 12, 10, NA, 12, 14, 10, 13, 15, 11, 14, 16, 20, 15,…\n$ gained         <dbl> 28, 41, 28, 29, 48, 45, 20, 65, 25, 22, 40, 30, 31, NA,…\n$ weight         <dbl> 6.96, 8.86, 7.51, 6.19, 6.75, 6.69, 6.13, 6.74, 8.94, 9…\n$ lowbirthweight <chr> \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", …\n$ sex            <chr> \"male\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\",…\n$ habit          <chr> \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"no…\n$ marital        <chr> \"married\", \"married\", \"married\", \"not married\", \"marrie…\n$ whitemom       <chr> \"white\", \"white\", \"not white\", \"white\", \"white\", \"white…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Bootstrap confidence intervals\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nConstruct and interpret a 95% confidence interval, using the standard error method with the `get_ci()` function, for the average length of gestation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nConstruct the interval **without** using the `get_ci()` (or `get_confidence_interval()`) function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWould you expect a 90% confidence interval for the average length of gestation to be wider or narrower?
