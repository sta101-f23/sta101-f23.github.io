Answering these questions (at a high level) is the focus of this analysis.\n\n### Packages\n\nWe will use the **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, **ggthemes** **lubridate**, and **scales** packages for data wrangling and visualization, and the **unvotes** package for the data.\n\n```{webr-r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(unvotes)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n### Data\n\nThe data we're using originally come from the **unvotes** package. In the chunk below we modify the data by joining the various data frames provided in the package to help you get started with the analysis.\n\n```{webr-r}\nunvotes <- un_votes |>\n  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = \"rcid\") |>\n  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = \"rcid\", relationship = \"many-to-many\")\n```\n\n## UN voting patterns\n\nLet's create a data visualization that displays how the voting record of the UK & NI changed over time on a variety of issues, and compares it to two other countries: US and Turkey.\n\nWe can easily change which countries are being plotted by changing which countries the code above `filter`s for. Note that the country name should be spelled and capitalized exactly the same way as it appears in the data. See the [Appendix](#appendix) for a list of the countries in the data.\n\n```{webr-r}\nunvotes |>\n  filter(country %in% c(\"United Kingdom\", \"United States\", \"Turkey\")) |>\n  mutate(year = year(date)) |>\n  group_by(country, year, issue) |>\n  summarize(percent_yes = mean(vote == \"yes\")) |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~issue) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +\n  scale_color_colorblind() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly\",\n    subtitle = \"1946 to 2019\",\n    y = \"% Yes\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  )\n```\n\n## References\n\n1.
