What do we mean by the distribution of the sample statistic?\n2.  What conditions need to be met?\n:::\n\n## The distribution of the sample statistic\n\n::: incremental\n-   You can build the distribution of the sample statistic by repeatedly taking samples of size n (original sample size) from the population and calculating and recording the sample statistic for each of these samples.\n\n-   But, you would never do this in reality!\n\n-   You'd either use simulation (randomization, bootstrapping, stuff we've done so far!) or you would leverage mathematical theory to know what to expect if we *had* taken repeated samples.\n:::\n\n## The (technical) conditions\n\n1.  **Independent observations:** Observations in the sample are independent. Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population. Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.\n\n2.  **Large enough sample:** The sample size cannot be too small. What qualifies as \"small\" differs from one context (i.e., from sample statistic to sample statistic).\n\n## More to the CLT\n\n-   There is more to the CLT than just the **shape** of the distribution -- normal.\n\n-   The CLT says that the **center** of the sampling distribution will be at the true population parameter.\n\n-   The CLT also says something about the **spread** of the sampling distribution, measured by the **standard error**. For each sample statistic ($\\bar{x}$ -- the sample mean, $\\hat{p}$ -- the sample proportion, $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2$ -- the difference in sample means, etc.) the CLT provides a formula for its standard error.\n\n    -   You won't be asked to memorize these formulas.\n\n    -   In fact, you'll rarely use the CLT to calculate the variability of sample statistics, you'll simulate their distributions directly.\n\n# Normal distribution\n\n## Normal distributions\n\n::: task\nHow are these normal distributions similar? How are they different? Which one is $N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma. 1)$ and which $N(\\mu = 19, \\sigma = 4)$?\n:::\n\n![](images/twoSampleNormals.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\n![](images/twoSampleNormalsStacked.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"599\"}\n\n## **The 68-95-99.7 rule**\n\nThe normal distribution is not just *any* unimodal and symmetric distribution, it follows the **68-95-99.7 rule**.\n\n![](images/er6895997.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Using the normal distribution...\n\n-   To make decisions $\\rightarrow$ hypothesis testing\n\n    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to determine the probability of the observed sample statistic (or something more extreme, in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), i.e. the p-value\n\n. . .\n\n-   To make estimations $\\rightarrow$ confidence intervals\n\n    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to calculate the bounds of the confidence interval, adding and subtracting a margin of error to the observed sample statistic\n\n. . .\n\nBut before then...\n\n## Application exercise\n\nGo to Posit Cloud and continue the project titled `ae-11-Bone density`.\n",
