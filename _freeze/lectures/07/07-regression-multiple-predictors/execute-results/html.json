An $R^2$ of 0 is a poor fit and $R^2$ of 1 is a perfect fit.\n:::\n\n## Finding $R^2$\n\nTo find $R^2$ simply call the function `glance()` on your `model_fit`, e.g.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  fit(outcome ~ predictor, data = data_set)\n  \nglance(model_fit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Models with multiple predictors\n\n## Two predictors {.smaller}\n\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n::: incremental\n-   $y$: the **outcome** variable. Also called the \"response\" or \"dependent variable\". In prediction problems, this is what we are interested in predicting.\n-   $x_i$: the $i^{th}$ **predictor**. Also commonly referred to as \"regressor\", \"independent variable\", \"covariate\", \"feature\", \"the data\".\n-   $\\beta_i$: \"constants\" or **coefficients** i.e. fixed numbers. These are **population parameters**. $\\beta_0$ has another special name, \"the intercept\".\n-   $\\epsilon$: the **error**. This quantity represents observational error, i.e. the difference between our observation and the true population-level expected value: $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n-   Effectively this model says our data $y$ is linearly related to the $x_1$ and $x_2$ but is not perfectly observed due to unexplained errors.\n:::\n\n## A simple example\n\nLet's examine the first quarter of 2020 high prices of Microsoft, IBM, and Apple stocks to illustrate some ideas.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07-regression-multiple-predictors_files/figure-revealjs/simple-example-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   If we have three measurements (variables) then each observation is a point in three-dimensional space. In this example, we can choose one of our measurements to be the outcome variable (e.g. Apple stock price) and use our other two measurements (MSFT and IBM price) as predictors.\n\n-   In general, the total number of measurements, i.e. variables (columns) in our linear model represents the spatial dimension of our model.\n\n## 2 predictors + 1 outcome = 3 dimensions\n\nThe fitted linear model no longer looks like a line, but instead looks like a **plane**. It shows our prediction of AAPL price ($y$) given both MSFT price ($x_1$) and IBM price ($x_2$).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07-regression-multiple-predictors_files/figure-revealjs/simple-example-plane-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Fitting a multiple regression model in R\n\nFind the **equation of the plane** by adding in new predictors:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_model_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  fit(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + predictor3 + ..., data = data_frame)\n```\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n-   This code template will fit the model according to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, i.e., we are finding the equation of the hyperplane that minimizes the sum of squared residuals\n\n. . .\n\n-   You can then display a tidy output of the model with the `tidy()` function on your fitted model: `tidy(my_model_fit)`\n\n## Application exercise\n\nGo to Posit Cloud and start the project titled ae-07-Books.\n\n::: callout-note\n## ICYMI\n\nToday's daily check-in access code: `___` (released in class)\n:::\n",
